# Gender Identification using Transfer Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project explores **Gender Identification** using **Transfer Learning** techniques in Deep Learning. By leveraging pre-trained models, we enhance the accuracy of gender classification while reducing the computational cost of training from scratch.

## 🚀 Features
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, and MobileNet.
- **Feature Extraction & Fine-Tuning**: Adapts existing deep learning architectures for improved performance.
- **Dataset Utilization**: Uses publicly available datasets for training and evaluation.
- **Bias & Ethical Considerations**: Addresses fairness and accuracy in AI-driven gender classification.
